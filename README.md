\# Forecasting Sales for Walmart (\[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy))



\*\*A neural network pipeline to forecast 28-day item-level sales for Walmart using time series modeling and PyTorch.\*\*



This project tackled the M5 Forecasting Accuracy challenge on Kaggle, where the goal was to predict daily sales across 30,000+ Walmart SKUs. I designed a custom PyTorch LSTM pipeline with engineered time series features, leveraging hierarchical statistics and custom batching for scalable training. The model outperformed a naive baseline by 21%, emphasizing both forecasting accuracy and efficient sequence generation.
